// Defining and Instantiating Structs
// https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch05-01-defining-structs.html



// For example, Listing 5-1 shows a struct that stores information about a user account.
struct User {
    active: bool,
    username: String,
    email: String,
    sign_in_count: u64,
}

fn main() {}







// Listing 5-2: Creating an instance of the User struct
struct User {
    active: bool,
    username: String,
    email: String,
    sign_in_count: u64,
}

fn main() {
    let user1 = User {
        email: String::from("someone@example.com"),
        username: String::from("someusername123"),
        active: true,
        sign_in_count: 1,
    };
}




// Listing 5-3: Changing the value in the email field of a User instance
struct User {
    active: bool,
    username: String,
    email: String,
    sign_in_count: u64,
}

fn main() {
    let mut user1 = User {
        email: String::from("someone@example.com"),
        username: String::from("someusername123"),
        active: true,
        sign_in_count: 1,
    };

    user1.email = String::from("anotheremail@example.com");
}








// Listing 5-4: A build_user function that takes an email and username and returns a User instance
struct User {
    active: bool,
    username: String,
    email: String,
    sign_in_count: u64,
}

fn build_user(email: String, username: String) -> User {
    User {
        email: email,
        username: username,
        active: true,
        sign_in_count: 1,
    }
}

fn main() {
    let user1 = build_user(
        String::from("someone@example.com"),
        String::from("someusername123"),
    );
}






// Using the Field Init Shorthand

// Listing 5-5: A build_user function that uses field init shorthand 
// because the email and username parameters have the same name as struct fields
struct User {
    active: bool,
    username: String,
    email: String,
    sign_in_count: u64,
}

fn build_user(email: String, username: String) -> User {
    User {
        email,
        username,
        active: true,
        sign_in_count: 1,
    }
}

fn main() {
    let user1 = build_user(
        String::from("someone@example.com"),
        String::from("someusername123"),
    );
}





// Creating Instances From Other Instances With Struct Update Syntax

// Listing 5-6: Creating a new User instance using one of the values from user1
struct User {
    active: bool,
    username: String,
    email: String,
    sign_in_count: u64,
}

fn main() {
    // --snip--

    let user1 = User {
        email: String::from("someone@example.com"),
        username: String::from("someusername123"),
        active: true,
        sign_in_count: 1,
    };

    let user2 = User {
        active: user1.active,
        username: user1.username,
        email: String::from("another@example.com"),
        sign_in_count: user1.sign_in_count,
    };
}




// Listing 5-7: Using struct update syntax to set a new email value 
// for a User instance but use the rest of the values from user1
struct User {
    active: bool,
    username: String,
    email: String,
    sign_in_count: u64,
}

fn main() {
    // --snip--

    let user1 = User {
        email: String::from("someone@example.com"),
        username: String::from("someusername123"),
        active: true,
        sign_in_count: 1,
    };

    let user2 = User {
        email: String::from("another@example.com"),
        ..user1
    };
}





// Using Tuple Structs without Named Fields to Create Different Types

// To define a tuple struct, start with the struct keyword and the struct 
// name followed by the types in the tuple. For example, here we define and 
// use two tuple structs named Color and Point:
struct Color(i32, i32, i32);
struct Point(i32, i32, i32);

fn main() {
    let black = Color(0, 0, 0);
    let origin = Point(0, 0, 0);
}






// Unit-Like Structs Without Any Fields

struct AlwaysEqual;

fn main() {
    let subject = AlwaysEqual;
}





// Ownership of Struct Data

// Lifetimes ensure that the data referenced by a struct is valid for as long as 
// the struct is. Let’s say you try to store a reference in a struct without specifying 
// lifetimes, like the following; this won’t work:
struct User {
    active: bool,
    username: &str,
    email: &str,
    sign_in_count: u64,
}

fn main() {
    let user1 = User {
        email: "someone@example.com",
        username: "someusername123",
        active: true,
        sign_in_count: 1,
    };
}
