// This is the main function
fn main() {
    // Statements here are executed when the compiled binary is called

    // Print text to the console
    println!("Hello World!");
}





/*
println! is a macro that prints text to the console.

A binary can be generated using the Rust compiler: rustc.

$ rustc hello.rs

rustc will produce a hello binary that can be executed.

$ ./hello
Hello World!
