- The HTML format is available online at [https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/) and offline with installations of Rust made with `rustup`; run `rustup docs --book` to open.

- Rust by Example (RBE) is a collection of runnable examples that illustrate various Rust concepts and standard libraries. To get even more out of these examples, don't forget to [install Rust locally](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) and check out the [official docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/). Additionally for the curious, you can also [check out the source code for this site](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-by-example).
